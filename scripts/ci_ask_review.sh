#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Ask the reviewer, by name, to review a run that waits on an environment gate;
# with `close`, settle the ask once the run has moved on.
#
# GitHub notifies an environment's required reviewers that a deployment waits —
# except a reviewer who is the run's own actor: nobody is notified of their own
# activity, and every run here is the owner's (the pushes and the dispatches
# ride their credentials). So the gate went unannounced. Each gated workflow
# runs this in a job beside the gated one, under that job's GITHUB_TOKEN: the
# issue is github-actions[bot]'s, and its @mention reaches the reviewer as
# anyone else's would (the web inbox, email, GitHub Mobile).
#
# The ask is an ISSUE titled "Approval needed: …" (2026-10-09), so the
# notification says what it wants and opens onto the review link. It was a
# commit comment, and GitHub titles those with the commit's subject and opens
# them below the whole diff. A job after the gated one runs `close`: it records
# the outcome in the body and the title and closes the issue — an edit and a
# close, never a comment: the outcome is on the page, not a second ping.
# The reviewer is read from the gate itself; the run's triggering actor stands
# in if GitHub will not say.
#
# THE PULL REQUEST'S THREAD (2026-10-09). Every change reaches main through a
# pull request now, and the gate's wait belongs where the change was argued:
# the issue names the pull request, and both the ask and the settle re-render
# that PR's pipeline report (scripts/ci_pr_report.py), which shows the wait —
# the Review deployments link, the plan, this issue — and then its outcome.
# The report is an EDIT, so the issue stays the one notification. A report
# that cannot be written is a warning: it never costs the ask.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_SERVER_URL (Actions
# sets the last three), TRIGGERING_ACTOR; GITHUB_OUTPUT receives `issue`.
# `close` reads ISSUE (the ask's number) and RESULT (the gated job's result).
