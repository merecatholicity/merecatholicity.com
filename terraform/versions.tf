# State lives in R2 (S3-compatible), bucket merecatholicity-tfstate. That bucket
# is deliberately NOT managed here: a state store managed by the state it holds
# cannot be bootstrapped or recovered. It was created by hand and stays that way.

# State contains secret material (Turnstile secret keys at minimum) and this
# repository is PUBLIC. Nothing under terraform/ may ever hold a credential:
# both tokens come from the environment. See README.md.
